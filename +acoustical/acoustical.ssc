domain acoustical
% Acoustical Domain
% Domain definition for a linear acoustical domain that uses 
% acoustical pressure (Pa) as the Across variable and volume
% velocity (m^3/s) as the Through variable. These variables are
% those conventionally used in acoustical system modeling
% as analog electrical circuit models. As a consequence, the 
% code that implements this acoustical domain is very similar to 
% the code that implements the electrical domain in the 
% MathWorks Fondation Library.
