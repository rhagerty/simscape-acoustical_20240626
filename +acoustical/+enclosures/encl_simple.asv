component encl_simple
% Simple acoustical enclosure
% All dimensions of the enclosure are assumed to be much less
% than the acoustic wavelength at any frequency included in the
% analysis. This component is a simple model that is a pure
% compliance, neglecting any loss that may exist in the
% enclosure.
